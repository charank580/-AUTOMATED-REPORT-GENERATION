##In this project, we developed an automated report generation system using Python to fulfill the given internship task of reading data from a file, analyzing it, and producing a formatted PDF output. We first created a sample dataset containing student details such as names, marks, and attendance percentages, which was saved as a CSV file. Using the pandas library, the script reads this dataset and performs basic statistical analysis with the describe() function, giving us key measures like average, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation. To make the results more insightful, the matplotlib library was used to generate a bar chart of student marks, visually comparing performance across individuals. For the final stage, the ReportLab library was used to automatically generate a PDF file that contains a title, a summary of the statistical analysis, and the chart as a visualization. The entire process demonstrates how Python can automate tasks that would otherwise require manual effort, ensuring consistency and saving time. The output of the script is a file named report.pdf, which includes the analyzed data in text format along with a visualization, making it both professional and easy to understand. Overall, this task successfully shows the integration of data handling, analysis, and presentation in one automated workflow, and the deliverables consist of the Python script along with the generated PDF report.
